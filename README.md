# Computer Infrastructure

************************
*My assessment repository* 
************************

This is the assessment repository for Computer Infrastructure module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in Winter 2024/25. 

**author: Monika Dabrowska**

## Overview

This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (weather.ipynb), `data` directory and other files that documents the process of completing Tasks 1 - 9 and Project for the assessment. The tasks involved creating directory structures, generating timestamps, downloading weather data, and managing files using command-line tools in a GitHub Codespace environment. Below is a summary of the notebook's content and the commands used.

## Requirements 

- Access to GitHub Codespaces with Bash enabled.

- Basic understanding of Bash commands and file operations.

- Internet connection for downloading data using `wget`.

## Task Summary 
### Task 1: Create Directory Structure
- **Goal**: Create a directory named `data` with subdirectories `timestamps` and `weather`.
- **Commands used**:

```bash
mkdir -p data/weather
cd data/
mkdir timestamps
```

The `mkdir -p` command ensures parent directories are created if they do not exist.

### Task 2: Timestamps
- **Goal**: Save the current date and time to `now.txt`, appending 10 entries.
- **Commands used**:

```bash
date +'%Y/%m/%d/ %H:%M:%S' >> now.txt
more now.txt
```
The `date` command outputs the current timestamp, while `>>` appends the output to the file. The `more` command displays the file content

### Task 3: Formatting Timestamps
- **Goal**: Append formatted timestamps `(YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS)` to `formatted.txt`.
- **Commands used**: 

```bash 
date -d "2026-11-14 13:00:03" +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S' >> formatted.txt
cat formatted.txt
```
The `cat` command is used to verify the content.

### Task 4: Create Timestamped Files
- **Goal**: Create empty files with timestamped names in the format `YYYYmmdd_HHMMSS.txt.`
- **Commands used**:

```bash
touch `date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`.txt
ls
```
Embedded backticks execute the `date` command inline to name the files.

### Task 5: Download Today's Weather Data
- **Goal**: Download the latest weather data from Met Ã‰ireann and save it as `weather.json.`
- **Commands used**:

```bash
wget -O weather.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today
ls
```
The `-O` option specifies the output filename.

### Task 6: Timestamp the Data
- **Goal**: Save the downloaded weather data with a timestamped filename.
- **Commands used**:

```bash
wget -O `date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`.json https://prodapi.metweb.ie/observations/athenry/today
ls
```
This ensures each file is uniquely named with a timestamp.


### Task 7: Write the Script
- **Goal**: Automate the tasks with a Bash script.
- **Commands used**: Full details are available in the [weather.ipynb](https://github.com/mondbr/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/weather.ipynb) notebook. 


### Task 8: Notebook
- **Goal**: Write a brief report of how tasks 1-7 were completed.
- **Commands used**: Full details are available in the [weather.ipynb](https://github.com/mondbr/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/weather.ipynb) notebook. 


### Task 9: pandas
- **Goal**: Using `pandas` function to load the data, summarise and examine it. 
- **Commands used**: Full details are available in the [weather.ipynb](https://github.com/mondbr/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/weather.ipynb) notebook.


### Project
- **Goal**: Automate the `weather.sh` script using GitHub Actions:
- **Commands used**: Full details are available in [weather-data.yml](https://github.com/mondbr/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/.github/workflows/weather-data.yml). 

- **Summary of actions**:

1. Create GitHub Actions Workflow:
    - In my repository, I created a `.github/workflows/` folder
    - Inside this folder, I created a file named `weather-data.yml` to define the GitHub Actions workflow.
2. Set Daily Run at 10am:
    - I used the `schedule` event with `cron` to run the script once a day at 10am.
    - I added the `workflow_dispatch` event to allow manual testing of the workflow.
3. Use Ubuntu Virtual Machine:
    - In the workflow file, I specified an Ubuntu virtual machine `(ubuntu-latest)` to run the action.
4. Clone the Repository:
    - Adding a step in the workflow to clone your repository. 
5. Execute the `weather.sh` script:
    - Adding a step to run `weather.sh` script within the workflow ensuring it is executable by `chmod +x weather.sh` .
6. Commit and Push Changes:
    - I used `env` and `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to authenticate and interact with the repository. The token is stored as a secret in the GitHub repository settings to keep it secure.
    - `git config`, `git add .`, `git commit - m` and `git push` automates the process of committing and pushing changes to your repository if any new changes have been made (e.g., updates to the weather data).


## Key Learnings and Notes
1. Command-line Utilities:
-  `touch`, `mkdir`, `date`, `wget`, `cat`, and more were crucial to task completion.
2. Timestamping Techniques:
- `date` formatting options `(%Y, %m, %d, %H, %M, %S)` were used to standardize file naming.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the repository and open it in a GitHub Codespace.

2. Ensure all required files and directories exist.

3. Run the notebook sequentially to replicate the tasks.
